# Contribute

This package continues to evolve and is distributed *as is*. There isn't any guarantee it will work for you out of the box or is tailored to your needs.

You are welcome to open issues when you see a problem, ask questions in the discussion, submit pull requests if you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, and improve the documentation. I really appreciate any help.
